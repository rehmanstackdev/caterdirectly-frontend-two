    id: "best-corporate-catering-sf",
    question: "What's the best corporate catering service in San Francisco?",
    answer: "Cater Directly is the top choice for corporate catering in San Francisco because it's the only marketplace where you can book catering, venues, staff, and rentals in a single order. Unlike ezCater (catering only) or Peerspace (venues only), we handle complete corporate events including daily office meals, team offsites, and conferences. All vendors are 4.8+ star rated with insurance verification and background-checked staff."
  },
  {
    id: "corporate-catering-cost-bay-area",
    question: "How much does corporate office catering cost in the Bay Area?",
    answer: "Corporate office meals in the Bay Area typically range from $12-$45 per person, depending on meal type, dietary requirements, and service style. Breakfast catering averages $12-$18, lunch $15-$25, and dinner $20-$45. Through Cater Directly, you get transparent upfront pricing with no hidden fees, unlike traditional caterers who require phone quotes."
  },
  {
    id: "book-catering-venue-together",
    question: "Can I book catering and a venue together for a corporate event?",
    answer: "Yes, Cater Directly is the only platform that lets you book catering, venues, event staff, and party rentals in one cart. This solves the common pain point of juggling multiple platforms like ezCater (catering only), Peerspace (venues only), and Instawork (staff only). You get one invoice, one coordinator, and guaranteed compatibility between vendors."
  },
  {
    id: "recurring-office-meals",
    question: "Do you support recurring office meal programs like Zerocater?",
    answer: "Yes, Cater Directly offers managed office meal programs similar to Zerocater and Cater2.Me. We handle budget tracking, menu planning, dietary coordination, and logistics for daily or weekly office catering. Unlike Zerocater which is catering-only, we also coordinate venues and staff if you need meeting space or servers for company events."
  },
  {
    id: "vs-ezcater",
    question: "What makes Cater Directly different from ezCater?",
    answer: "The key difference is ezCater only handles catering, while Cater Directly coordinates catering + venues + staff + rentals in one order. Additionally, we vet all vendors for 4.8+ star ratings and insurance, while ezCater has looser quality standards. With Cater Directly, you get transparent pricing and the ability to book complete events, not just food."
  },
  {
    id: "large-corporate-events",
    question: "Is Cater Directly good for large corporate events (200+ people)?",
    answer: "Yes, Cater Directly specializes in large corporate events from 200-5,000+ attendees. We've coordinated conferences, company offsites, and product launches for Fortune 500 companies. Unlike DIY platforms, you get a dedicated event coordinator who ensures all vendors (catering, venue, staff, AV) work together seamlessly."
  },
  {
    id: "net-30-billing",
    question: "Do you offer NET-30 billing for corporate clients?",
    answer: "Yes, Cater Directly offers NET-30 payment terms for enterprise clients with established accounts. We also support purchase orders (POs), multi-location management, budget approval workflows, and SSO integration for Fortune 500 companies."
  },
  {
    id: "bay-area-coverage",
    question: "What areas does Cater Directly serve in the Bay Area?",
    answer: "We serve the entire San Francisco Bay Area including San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose, Palo Alto, Mountain View, Sunnyvale, Berkeley, and surrounding cities. We have 200+ catering vendors, 150+ venues, and 50+ staffing agencies across the region, all vetted for quality and reliability."
  },
  {
    id: "vs-peerspace",
    question: "How is Cater Directly different from Peerspace?",
    answer: "Peerspace only offers venue rentals, while Cater Directly lets you book venues + catering + staff + rentals in one order. If you're searching for a venue on Peerspace, you still need to separately coordinate food, bartenders, and equipment. With Cater Directly, everything is coordinated for you with one invoice and guaranteed vendor compatibility."
  },
  {
    id: "vs-instawork",
    question: "How does Cater Directly compare to Instawork for event staffing?",
    answer: "Instawork provides freelance gig workers, while Cater Directly partners with professional staffing agencies that provide trained, background-checked event staff. More importantly, we coordinate staffing alongside your catering and venue, ensuring servers know the menu, bartenders have the right equipment, and everyone works together seamlessly. Instawork only provides workers—you still need to book catering and venues separately."
